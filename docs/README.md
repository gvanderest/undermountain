## What is Undermountain?

Undermountain is a Python3 MUD engine.  It is inspired by by existing MUDs, but also has influences from MMORPGs and Action RPGs that have come over the years.  The example world that comes with the engine will contain examples of the technologies and tools available, but what you create will be your own.
